# Technique T0039: Prepare fundraising campaigns

* **Summary**: Fundraising campaigns refer to an influence operationâ€™s systematic effort to seek financial  support for a charity, cause, or other enterprise using online activities that further promote  operation information pathways while raising a profit. Many influence operations have engaged  in crowdfunding services on platforms including Tipee, Patreon, and GoFundMe. An operation  may use its previously prepared fundraising campaigns (see: Develop Information Pathways) to  promote operation messaging while raising money to support its activities.
